**Mission:**

  To display complex information in a way that is easy to read, attractive and upholds district branding standards.

**Implementation:**

  Pages were developed in conjunction with Republic Media, printed and delivered to all residential addresses in Mesa, Arizona as well as local businesses. The original roll-out of Achieve was a huge hit, as community members (including those with children in the district or not) felt more engaged with their school district. The magazine has won several awards for its innovation in transparency to stakeholders.
