**Mission:**

  To develop a more modern web presence that would display the company as a premiere choice as a construction general contractor, portraying a confident and professional brand that shows integrity in its work and business model.

**Implementation:**

  Years before, we created the branding behind Tequa Builders, but the web had passed by its original vision and it was time for an update. Originally, the Tequa Builders website was built in WordPress, but the look had become outdated, the information needed a facelift and the images were uninviting.

  Because the client was utilizing the website more as a landing page to generate business, it didn't make sense to keep the site on such a bloated CMS like WordPress. Because content didn't need to be changed or added constantly, it was more important from the customer's standpoint to load as quickly as possible, especially since the site was utilizing shared hosting services, so the decision was made to hard-code all the pages, instead.

  The redesign was built on the Bootstrap framework and utilizes parallax scrolling, along with several custom CSS and jQuery libraries with a simple PHP form on the contact page. The website's load time has increased exponentially, with an 85/100 score on mobile, 94/100 on desktop and 100/100 in user experience, according to Google's PageSpeed analytics. While there is still room for improvement moving forward, in which we intend to rebuild the website in Jekyll over the the coming year, the current website is performing great and has been generating significant leads.
