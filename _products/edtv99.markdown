**Mission:**

  To develop a new identity for EdTV 99 that modernized its appearance, giving the brand a higher-quality look on videos shown on Cox Channel 99 and its YouTube channel, while allowing the identity to reflect the brand's values under Mesa Public Schools and its individuality as a video outfit.

**Implementation:**

  Several different logos were hand-drawn and digitized for consideration for the rebranding project. Unfortunately, because of restructuring within the organization and a change of management, the final logo was never decided upon or implemented. Possibilities of it being adopted still remain.
